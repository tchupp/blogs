# Priority vs Urgency

## Urgency

Urgency is how soon something should be completed.

## Priority

Priority is where the majority of my time will be spent.

As an engineer on a team, my priorities are:
1. Growing and supporting my teammates
2. Incidents and customer support (on my current team, my customers are other engineers at my company)
3. Building or working on new stuff

This list does not change.
